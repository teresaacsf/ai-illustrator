# Story Illustrator Web App

A web application built with Flask and JavaScript that allows users to illustrate their stories using the Stable Diffusion API. This project processes user-submitted stories to generate creative prompts through a keyword selection model and sends them to the Stable Diffusion model for illustration.

## Features

- **Automatic Keyword Extraction:**
  - Utilizes the YAKE (Yet Another Keyword Extractor) algorithm to automatically generate keywords from user stories, simplifying the prompt creation process.

- **Custom Prompt Creation:**
  - Users can manually edit or create prompts based on the extracted keywords to tailor the generated images to their vision.

- **Stable Diffusion Integration:**
  - Seamlessly connects with the Stable Diffusion API to generate high-quality illustrations based on user-defined prompts.

- **Dynamic Image Display:**
  - Generated images are displayed in real-time below each story input area, providing immediate visual feedback for users.


## Technologies Used

- Flask (Python)
- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS
- YAKE (Keyword extraction)
- Stable Diffusion API

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/teresaacsf/ai-illustrator.git
   cd ai-illustrator
   
2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
      ```bash
      python -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
   
4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py

## Usage

Follow these steps to illustrate your stories using the web app:

1. **Open the Web Application:**
   - Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your web browser.

2. **Input Your Story:**
   - In the provided text areas, enter your story. You can fill out multiple text areas to illustrate different parts of your story.

3. **Select Keywords (Optional):**
   - If you wish to generate a prompt automatically, you can use the "Automatic Generation" button. This will extract keywords from your story using the YAKE algorithm.
   - Alternatively, you can manually enter a prompt in the corresponding text box below each story input area.

4. **Generate the Image:**
   - Click the "Generate Image" button next to the prompt text area to send your prompt to the Stable Diffusion API. The generated image will be displayed in the image container below each respective text area.

5. **View the Generated Images:**
   - After the processing is complete, the illustrations generated by Stable Diffusion will appear in the designated image containers.
